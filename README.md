# practical_task

This is the implementation of Lab 1 in Flutter

# What's new?

This lab has a feature:
every time the list tile is added or re-rendered it changes its colour to a random one
Therefore I imported a new library random_colors

## Setup
#### First run ```flutter pub get``` for running the app

## Start
#### Run command is ```flutter run```
